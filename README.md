I am studying CS postgraduate, British, technical level is very solid, and ghostwriting experience is very rich, to help Australia rmit, The University of Adelaide, The University of Melbourne, as well as the UK and Canada and other schools of students to complete the homework, and get very satisfactory scores.

## 优势
最重要的是！！你在其他地方找到的辅导代写都是以机构的形式.
机构是怎么运作的呢？负责你的客服把你的要求记下来，传给分任务的人，然后分任务的那个人再把单子给很多的派单人员，派单人员再联系自己的写手同学。这些写手同学大部分都是从高校论坛里随便发个帖子就找来的，能力行不行，能不能做好，根本就无从考究，你的作业质量一点都没有办法保证。而且还要做之前就给中介全款。**太坑了有没有！！！** 臃肿的组织结构也决定了你要花很多的钱，毕竟那些客服都靠客户养。

但是你找我的话，我是个人营业，而且经验非常丰富。质量比他们高，而且价格肯定中介低，点对点，没有中间商赚差价。

Most importantly!! The tutoring ghostwriting you find elsewhere is in the form of an agency.
How does the organization work? The person in charge of your customer service will write down your requirements and pass them on to the person who will then pass them on to a number of people who will then contact their fellow writers. Most of these writers are from the university forum to find a random post, ability, can not do well, there is no research, the quality of your homework is not guaranteed. And pay the agent in full before you do it. ** too pit have!! The bloated organizational structure also determines that you have to spend a lot of money, after all, those customer service are dependent on customers.

But if you want to see me, I'm a private trader, and I have a lot of experience. The quality is higher than them, and the price must be lower intermediary, peer-to-peer, This is the lowest price due to direct sale to our customers without distributor.
